# Stage 19 worklog

**Stage target:** `quotation-system-docs/development-cycles/stage-19.md` — Delete routes + UI/UX bug sweep
**Profile:** `.engineering/stage-19/profile.md`
**Branch:** `release/stage-19` (cut from `master` @ `753ce28`, 2026-09-09)

## Work items

| # | Item | Files (disjoint?) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Floor/Project DELETE routes | `lib/data/floors.ts`, `lib/data/projects.ts`, `lib/data/inquiries.ts`, `app/api/v1/orgs/[orgSlug]/floors/[id]/route.ts` (new), `app/api/v1/orgs/[orgSlug]/projects/[projectId]/route.ts`, `tests/e2e/stage19.spec.ts` (new) | pending |
| 2 | Shared `SelectField` + radio→dropdown fix | new `components/select-field.tsx` + 14 consumer files, `lib/component-catalog-seed.ts`, `create-component-form.tsx` | pending |
| 3 | Configuration-page UX (popover + loading fixes) | `add-selection-form.tsx`, `configuration/loading.tsx`, `list-page-controls.tsx` | pending |
| 4 | Wizard fixes (copy, Back button, step-gating) | `project-wizard-breadcrumb.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `_project-fetch.ts` | pending |
| 5 | SuperAdmin Component-Type relocation | new `app/api/v1/superadmin/component-types/**`, `/controls` UI, retiring old `/admin/components` route + its E2E specs | pending |
| 6 | Remaining loading/placeholder sweep | Inquiry/Orders screen spot-check | pending |

Items 2-3 likely share `add-selection-form.tsx` — sequence, don't parallelize those two. Item 1 is
independent and unblocks fixture cleanup for the rest; build it first.

## Activity log

- 2026-09-09 — Conductor: consolidated Stage 19 scope (delete routes + video-feedback UI/UX items) written
  to `stage-19.md`, GATE 0 decisions locked (anchored popover; sweep all 14 files; placeholder-text fix,
  not CSS dividers; remove Back button from all 5 steps). `release/stage-19` confirmed checked out and
  clean. `profile.md` seeded. Starting Batch 1 (delete routes) next.
- 2026-09-09 — Developer (batch-1 plan): wrote `.engineering/stage-19/plan-batch1.md`. No deviations from
  approved scope. Confirmed: floors `[id]` route dir does not yet exist; `deleteRoom` shape verified at
  `lib/data/rooms.ts:284-293`; transaction precedent at `lib/data/superadmin/orgs.ts:362-380`; RBAC pattern
  at `rooms/[id]/route.ts:90-91`; DRAFT gate at `lib/data/projects.ts:346`; Inquiry guard at
  `lib/data/inquiries.ts:463`. Plan covers 7 files, 2 E2E tests, SQL doc update. Ready to build.
